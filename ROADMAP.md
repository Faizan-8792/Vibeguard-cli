# VibeGuard — Roadmap & Command Guide

> **What is VibeGuard?**
> A local-only CLI that helps you and your AI coding assistant understand a codebase
> *cheaply and safely*. It maps your dependencies, finds secrets and attack surfaces,
> removes dead code reversibly, scores project health, packs minimal context for AI
> (80–95% fewer tokens), and now compresses AI replies with **Caveman Mode**.
>
> **Everything runs on your machine.** No cloud, no native build, Node ≥ 18.

## 1. Quick Start (60 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Install (global) — or symlink the repo for local dev
npm install -g vibeguard

# 2. Set up the project (creates .vibeguard/, all gitignored)
vibeguard init

# 3. Build the dependency graph
vibeguard map

# 4. Open the interactive menu — easiest way to use everything
vibeguard --run
```

That's it. From the interactive menu you can reach **every** feature below without
remembering a single flag.

## 2. The 5 Things People Use Most

| I want to… | Run this | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Save AI tokens on every reply | `vibeguard caveman on` | Terse, high-signal AI answers (~35–75% fewer tokens) |
| Give my AI the *right* files only | `vibeguard pack "fix login bug"` | A focused context bundle, not the whole repo |
| Find leaked secrets / risky code | `vibeguard --scan` | Secrets, `.gitignore` gaps, framework misuse |
| See how my project is doing | `vibeguard --health` | One 0–100 score with sub-scores |
| Visualize the codebase | `vibeguard graph` | Interactive HTML dependency map |

## 4. ⭐ Caveman Mode — Save Tokens & Boost Speed

> *"Why use many token when few do trick."*

Makes your AI assistant answer like a smart caveman: drop filler, keep 100% technical
accuracy, reply in dense fragments. Inspired by the
[`caveman`](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) skill. *(Description rephrased for
compliance with the source's licensing.)*

**Use it:**
```bash
vibeguard caveman on          # enable (default level: full)
vibeguard caveman on ultra    # enable at max compression
vibeguard caveman level lite  # change level, stays on
vibeguard caveman status      # check current state
vibeguard caveman benchmark   # show real measured token savings per level
vibeguard caveman off         # back to normal prose
```
Or pick **🪨 Caveman Mode** from `vibeguard --run`. One-step setup with your
assistant: `vibeguard install --platform kiro --caveman ultra`. An AI agent can
also toggle it live through the MCP `set_caveman` tool, and `vibeguard doctor`
reports whether it's on.

**Levels:** `lite` (~35%, full sentences) · `full` (~65%, classic) · `ultra` (~75%, telegraphic).

**How it sticks across every chat:** enabling writes an *always-on* rule file your
assistant reads each turn — `.kiro/steering/vibeguard-caveman.md` for Kiro, plus mirrors
for Cursor (`.cursor/rules`), Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules`), and a marker-fenced block in
`CLAUDE.md` / Copilot / Gemini / `AGENTS.md` / `.windsurfrules` / `.clinerules` **if those
already exist**. Every reply starts with a visible `🪨 Caveman mode: ON (<level>)` line so
you always know it's active. State lives in `.vibeguard/caveman.json`. Turning it off
removes every rule cleanly. Code, commits, and security warnings are always written in full
prose — safety first.

> **Important:** assistants read always-on rules at the **start of a chat session**. After
> `caveman on`, open a **new chat** (or reload the IDE window) so the rule loads — otherwise
> the current chat won't change.

## 5. Status — Now / Next / Later

### ✅ Now (shipped & tested — 293 tests passing)
- **Core graph:** incremental `map` (SHA-256 change detection), file add/delete tracking
  with `+added`/`-removed` deltas, `watch`, interactive HTML graph, architecture report.
- **Understanding:** `query`, `explain`, `affected`, `path`, `flows`, `search`, `benchmark`.
- **Security & safety:** `security` (+fixes), `attack` (+AI fix), reversible `clean`/`trash`,
  `doctor` health score, git `hook`.
- **AI context & output:** `pack`, `add` (PDF), **Caveman Mode**, risk-scored `review`.
- **Integration:** `install`/`uninstall` for 6 assistants, MCP `serve`, interactive `--run`.

### 🔜 Next (close the gaps — small, high-value)
- [x] `install --caveman [level]` enables Caveman in the same step (one-command setup)
- [x] `uninstall` also removes the Caveman rule file (no leftover on teardown)
- [x] MCP `set_caveman` tool so an agent can toggle Caveman live, mid-chat
- [x] `doctor` shows a "Caveman: on (ultra)" status line (text + JSON)
- [x] `caveman benchmark` — real measured token savings per level (deterministic compressor)

### 🛡️ Security Hardening — best-of Trivy + Semgrep + CodeQL (local, zero-network) — SHIPPED ✅
*Inspired by Trivy (SCA + misconfig + SBOM), Semgrep & CodeQL (taint dataflow). All
runs locally with no API key; advisory data is bundled, not fetched.*

- [x] **Dependency audit (SCA)** — `dependency-auditor.ts`: parses `package.json` +
      lockfiles, matches installed versions against a bundled vulnerability advisory DB
      (semver-range aware), flags known-vulnerable, deprecated, and risky-license deps
- [x] **SBOM output** — `vibeguard audit --sbom` emits a CycloneDX component inventory
- [x] **Taint dataflow analysis** — `taint-analyzer.ts`: tracks untrusted sources
      (`req.body`/`req.query`/`process.argv`/etc.) to dangerous sinks (exec, query, eval,
      `innerHTML`, fetch, fs) with sanitizer awareness + confidence scoring
- [x] **Misconfiguration scan (IaC)** — `misconfig-scanner.ts`: Dockerfile, `.env`,
      CI workflows, and `tsconfig` insecure settings
- [x] **Unified `vibeguard audit`** — runs SCA + taint + misconfig + secret + attack
      scans, with a 0-100 security score and `--json` contract
- [x] Folded dependency findings into `doctor`, and exposed an MCP `run_audit` tool

### 🌅 Later (bigger bets)
- [ ] **Exports:** `visualize --format graphml|cypher|obsidian|svg`, `wiki`, `graph-diff <ref>`
- [ ] **Multi-repo:** `register`/`repos`, `cross-search`, background daemon, `~/.vibeguard/watch.toml`
- [ ] **Proof & reach:** deterministic eval pipeline, published benchmarks (token reduction,
      impact recall), 15+ languages, VS Code extension, CI hardening (coverage + cross-OS)

## 6. How VibeGuard Works (A → Z)

1. **Install** → `npm i -g vibeguard` (Node ≥ 18, no native build).
2. **Init** → `vibeguard init` writes `.vibeguard/` (config + artifacts, gitignored).
3. **Map** → resolves the live file set, parses imports/exports, builds `graph.json`
   incrementally (unchanged files are skipped via SHA-256 hashes).
4. **Track** → new files auto-added, deleted files auto-pruned; `map`/`watch` report deltas.
5. **Understand** → `query`/`explain`/`affected`/`path`/`flows`/`search` answer from the graph.
6. **Secure** → `security` + `attack` find risks; `clean` removes dead code to recoverable trash.
7. **Score** → `doctor` rolls it all into one health number.
8. **Pack** → `pack "<task>"` builds a minimal AI context bundle.
9. **Compress** → `caveman on` shrinks AI output on every reply.
10. **Integrate** → `install` wires it into your assistant; `serve` exposes live MCP tools.

---

## 7. Guiding Principles (don't break these)

1. **Zero token cost for the core.** Graph, query, security, dead-code, health stay 100% local.
2. **No native compilation.** Pure TypeScript on Node ≥ 18 — never add a native build step.
3. **Stable JSON contracts.** Every command emits one JSON doc with `schemaVersion`.
4. **Safety first.** Mutations are opt-in, support `--dry-run`, and route deletes through recoverable trash.
5. **Loaders are TTY-only.** Never corrupt `--json` / CI output.
6. **No repo litter.** Integrations only touch files you already have; everything is reversible.
7. **The moat is non-negotiable.** Security, cyberattack defense, reversible cleanup, health
   scoring, and Caveman compression are the combination no competitor matches — keep them first-class.

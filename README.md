## ⭐ Feeling tough to install?

> **Don't read docs. Just run one command — VibeGuard does the rest.**
>
> ```bash
> npx vibeguard --run
> ```
>
> That opens an **interactive menu** where every feature is one keypress away — security scan,
> health score, dependency graph, dead-code cleanup, AI context packs, and more.
> No config, no setup, no flags to memorize. **Zero to running in one line.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/cli-demo.png" alt="VibeGuard interactive CLI menu" width="80%" />
</p>

<p align="center"><em>The interactive menu — pick a tool, get an answer. (Run <code>npx vibeguard --run</code> to see it live.)</em></p>

> **Note:** drop your own terminal screenshot at `docs/assets/cli-demo.png` to replace this image.

Prefer flags? Every action also has a one-line shortcut:

```bash
npx vibeguard --scan      # security scan
npx vibeguard --health    # project health score (0-100)
npx vibeguard --graph     # build + open the dependency graph
npx vibeguard --dead      # detect dead code
```

## 💡 Why VibeGuard?

AI assistants are strongest when they read the **right** code, not **all** the code.
VibeGuard builds a local, structured map of your project so your AI works with less
noise, fewer tokens, and higher accuracy — and you get a security and architecture
toolkit for free.

  B --> E[Dead-code plan]
  C --> F[Focused context pack]
  C --> H[Interactive graph.html]
  F --> G[AI reads 5-15<br/>relevant files]
  G --> K[Cheaper + sharper<br/>AI answers]
```

> **Core promise:** graph, security, dead-code, health, query, and packaging all run
> **locally with no AI API key**. Only the optional `attack --ai` review uses your LLM.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Easiest — interactive menu, everything in one place
npx vibeguard --run

# Or step by step
npx vibeguard init                      # create .vibeguard/ (gitignored)
npx vibeguard map                       # build the dependency graph
npx vibeguard pack "fix the auth flow"  # focused context for an AI task
npx vibeguard doctor                    # quality + health score
```

Requirements: **Node.js ≥ 18** and a project directory. Git is optional (enables hooks + git-aware scoring).

## 🔌 MCP Server — Live Agent Tools

Instead of shelling out and screen-scraping, AI assistants can call VibeGuard's engines
directly as **Model Context Protocol** tools over stdio. Local, zero-network (except the
optional AI scan), **13 tools**.

```bash
vibeguard serve            # start the MCP server on stdio
vibeguard mcp              # alias for serve
vibeguard serve --tools get_minimal_context,pack_context,query_graph   # expose a subset
```

### Wire it into your client

**Claude Desktop / Claude Code** — `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibeguard": { "command": "npx", "args": ["vibeguard", "serve", "--cwd", "/abs/path/to/project"] }
  }
}
```

**Kiro** — `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` · **Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibeguard": { "command": "npx", "args": ["vibeguard", "serve"], "disabled": false }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** — `.vscode/mcp.json` (note: VS Code uses the `servers` key):

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "vibeguard": { "command": "npx", "args": ["vibeguard", "serve"] }
  }
}
```

> Tip: `vibeguard vscode install` and `vibeguard codex install` write these configs for you.

### The 13 tools

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_minimal_context` | Ultra-compact project summary (~100 tokens). Call first. |
| `pack_context` | Focused, token-budgeted file pack for a task. |
| `query_graph` | Answer a codebase question by traversing the graph. |
| `find_path` | Shortest dependency path between two files. |
| `explain_node` | A node's role, imports, dependents, importance. |
| `get_affected` | Blast radius: what transitively depends on a node. |
| `build_graph` | Build or incrementally update the graph. |
| `detect_dead_code` | Unused files & exports. |
| `scan_security` | Secrets, framework misuse, gitignore gaps. |
| `scan_attacks` | Cyberattack vulnerabilities. |
| `get_health` | Project Health Score with sub-scores. |
| `run_audit` | Unified audit → 0-100 security score. |
| `set_caveman` | Toggle Caveman Mode. |

## 🗺️ Interactive Dependency Graph

`vibeguard graph` builds a **self-contained interactive HTML map** of your codebase
(`.vibeguard/graph.html`) and opens it in the browser.

```bash
vibeguard map      # build/refresh graph data
vibeguard graph    # render + open the interactive view
```

- **2D force-directed layout** — nodes auto-arrange by connectivity, then physics freezes
- **Group colors** — core, commands, engines, storage, utils, tests
- **Search box** — type a filename; matches highlight, the rest dim
- **Tap-hold + drag to pan** — move the whole map like dragging an image
- **Click a node** — highlights connections and opens a links panel (Imports / Dependents)
- **Degree-scaled nodes** — busier files render larger (god-node spotting)

## 🪨 Caveman Mode

Makes your AI assistant reply terse — drop filler, keep 100% technical accuracy. Inspired
by the [`caveman`](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) skill. *(Rephrased for compliance.)*

```bash
vibeguard caveman on          # enable (default: full)
vibeguard caveman on ultra    # maximum compression
vibeguard caveman status      # check state
vibeguard caveman off         # back to normal prose
```

| Level | Effect | ~Output savings (prose) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lite` | Drop filler & hedging, keep full sentences | ~20% |
| `full` | Drop articles, fragments OK (classic) | ~30% |
| `ultra` | Telegraphic, minimal words, arrows (X → Y) | ~45% |

> Savings are honest prose-only estimates — code, commands, and identifiers are never
> compressed. The bigger win is fast, high-signal answers.

---

## 🤝 Editor & Agent Setup

```bash
vibeguard install --platform kiro     # also: cursor, claude, copilot, vscode, codex, gemini, aider
vibeguard vscode install              # shortcut form
vibeguard codex install               # writes AGENTS.md (covers Codex + AGENTS.md agents)
```

Each writes the right integration file for that tool (rules / instructions / MCP config) and
teaches the agent to go graph-first. Use `uninstall` to cleanly remove generated files.

---

## 🧩 Programmatic API

```ts
import { generateContextForEditor, serializeContextPackageForAgent } from 'vibeguard';

const pkg = await generateContextForEditor('fix auth login', { radius: 2, budget: 12000, mode: 'bugfix' });
const markdown = serializeContextPackageForAgent(pkg);
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faizan-8792/VIBEGUARD-.git
cd VIBEGUARD-
npm install
npm run lint     # tsc --noEmit
npm run build    # tsc
npm test         # vitest — 369 tests
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Attack Coverage

VibeGuard ships **three local scanners** plus an optional AI deep-scan. All run offline with
no API key (only `attack --ai` uses your configured LLM).

```bash
vibeguard security                    # secret + framework scan
vibeguard attack                      # cyberattack pattern scan (36 types)
vibeguard audit                       # unified 5-engine audit + 0-100 score
vibeguard attack --ai --fix           # AI deep-scan + auto-fix (with backups)
```

### `security` — secrets & framework misuse (18 detectors)

Hard-coded credentials and risky framework usage, low-false-positive, with an
`.env`/`.gitignore` gap check.

- **Secrets:** OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS access key + secret, JWT secret, DB URL, Supabase,
  Google/Gemini, GitHub token, Stripe key, Slack token, Twilio SID, PEM private keys,
  generic api-key/token assignments.
- **Framework:** CORS wildcard origin, `cors()` with no config, hard-coded `ACAO: *`.
- **Hygiene:** `.env` present but missing from `.gitignore`.

### `attack` — cyberattack vulnerabilities (36 detectors, OWASP-aligned)

Mitigation-aware: a finding is suppressed when a matching defense is present in the file.

| Category | Covered attack types |
| --- | --- |
| **Injection** | SQLi (interpolation + concat), NoSQLi, XSS, command injection, XXE, insecure deserialization, SSTI, prototype pollution, `eval`/`new Function` RCE, CRLF / response splitting, LDAP injection |
| **Auth** | Brute force / credential stuffing, OTP abuse / SMS bombing, CSRF, JWT `none`-algorithm, `jwt.decode` without verify |
| **Access control** | Path traversal, SSRF, open redirect, mass assignment, unrestricted file upload, CORS origin reflection, insecure `postMessage` target |
| **Cryptography** | Weak hashing (MD5/SHA1), weak password hashing, insecure `Math.random()`, disabled TLS validation, hardcoded session secret, timing-unsafe secret compare |
| **Availability** | DDoS / resource exhaustion (missing rate limits), ReDoS (user-built RegExp) |
| **Hardening** | Missing security headers (helmet/CSP), insecure cookie flags, service bound to `0.0.0.0` |
| **Disclosure** | Sensitive data in logs, stack-trace exposure in responses |

### `audit` — unified offline audit (best-of Trivy + Semgrep + CodeQL)

`vibeguard audit` runs **five local engines** in one pass → a single **0-100 security score**.

| Engine | Inspired by | What it finds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency audit (SCA) | Trivy | Known-vulnerable deps (bundled advisory DB), deprecated packages, risky licenses |
| SBOM | Trivy | CycloneDX component inventory (`--sbom`) |
| Taint dataflow | Semgrep / CodeQL | Untrusted sources → dangerous sinks (exec, eval, query, innerHTML, fetch, fs), sanitizer-aware |
| Misconfiguration + hardening | Trivy + dev-sec | Dockerfile, `.env`, CI workflows, `tsconfig`, **SSH `sshd_config`, nginx, MySQL** baselines |
| Secrets + attacks | — | Reuses the secret + cyberattack scanners |

Supported AI providers for `--ai`: OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek,
Groq, Mistral, xAI, Together, Perplexity, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Moonshot/Kimi, Ollama, and
any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

> **Honest limit:** these are static heuristics — they catch common, pattern-detectable
> issues, not logic flaws, business-process abuse, or runtime-only vulnerabilities. Treat
> VibeGuard as a strong first line, not a full replacement for a security audit.

### Safety model

| Guarantee | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Local core | Graph, security, health, dead-code, query, pack need no cloud AI |
| Read-only default | Mutations require explicit `--fix`, `--apply`, or hook/integration install |
| Recoverable | Removed files go to `.vibeguard-trash/` |
| Project boundary | Safety checks reject paths outside the project root |
| Secrets | LLM credentials live in `.vibeguard/credentials.json` with restrictive perms |
